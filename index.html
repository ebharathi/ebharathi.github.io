            <h2>Frontend Developer - Sirma Global | Internship</h2>
            <p>
                I developed a frontend back-office module using Next.js and implemented Redux for state management. As
                part of this, I
                designed various reusable components such as Tables, Modals, Accordions, and Inputs using Tailwind CSS.
                These components
                were structured to ensure consistency and efficiency across the application.

                Additionally, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the legacy Angular.js-based back-office product
                and the Member
                Onboarding platform. This involved familiarizing myself with their respective workflows and
                architectures.

                I actively contributed to the maintenance and enhancement of the back-office system by debugging and
                resolving issues
                within critical modules like Transaction Monitor and Loan Workflow. These efforts included identifying
                and fixing bugs
                to ensure smooth operation and reliability.

                Furthermore, I extended the functionality of the Member Onboarding platform by implementing new
                validation mechanisms
                and introducing additional modules. These enhancements aimed to streamline the onboarding process and
                improve user
                experience.

            <h2>Fullstack Developer - Robert Bosch | Trainee</h2>
            <p>
                I involved in the development of a comprehensive website using React.js, where I adeptly integrated
                Bosch's proprietary
                modules and design libraries. This involved mastering the use of Bosch's specialized tools and adhering
                to their design
                guidelines to ensure consistency and alignment with the company's branding and usability standards.

                To facilitate seamless developer interaction, I implemented Redoc to showcase API documentation,
                ensuring clarity and
                accessibility for internal stakeholders. Access was restricted to internal use only, safeguarding
                sensitive information
                while promoting collaboration among team members.

                Additionally, I embarked on a React Native mobile project using Expo, focusing on enhancing user
                engagement through push
                notifications triggered by user orders. I integrated the project with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and
                Firestore,
                leveraging these platforms for real-time data synchronization and efficient messaging capabilities.

                Throughout the development lifecycle, I utilized Android Studio and emulators to develop and rigorously
                test the
                application across various device environments. This approach ensured robust functionality and smooth
                performance on
                Android devices, contributing to a user-friendly mobile experience.

            <h2>Fullstack Developer - Travelfika | Part Time</h2>
            <p>
                I worked as a part-time employee, contributing to the development of a comprehensive booking website
                that encompassed
                flights, hotels, and experiences. My responsibilities included designing the frontend and backend
                components for the
                search, availability, booking, and ticketing processes for both flights and hotels.

                I integrated a Payment Gateway into the backend server and implemented MVC flow using node.js, mongoDB.I
                also played a
                key role in designing a chatbot that integrated with GPT and fine-tuned my own model.

                In terms of technology, my work involved using a robust tech stack that included Typescript, React,
                NodeJS, Stripe for
                payment integration, and the implementation of cronjobs for scheduled tasks. The exposure to these
                technologies not only
                enhanced my technical skills but also allowed me to gain practical experience in the development of
                complex systems.

                This collaborative experience allowed me to work alongside a diverse team under the guidance of a great
                mentor,
                providing me with valuable learning opportunities and insights.


                Overall, my time as a part-time employee was marked by meaningful contributions to a dynamic project,
                continuous
                learning from experienced professionals, and the opportunity to engage with a diverse set of
                technologies and
                challenges.
